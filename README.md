# prophet-challenge
Module 8 Google colab analysis using Prophet.
This homework challenge had us analyzing Mercado Libre traffic patterns on their website.
We were to find out if the Google search traffic for the company links to any financial events at the company.
We mined the search traffic data for seasonality
We then related the search traffic to stock price patterns
We then created a time series model with Prophet.

I did use the tool of chatGPT to help trouble shoot some of my code.
